# Click Through Rate Prediction Model Documentation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the Click Through Rate (CTR) prediction model developed during my internship at Genting Casinos UK. The objective of this project was to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) models in combination with gradient boosting techniques to predict the click-through rate of an email body, which would be sent as a promotional campaign.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consisted of historical email campaigns along with their corresponding click-through rates. Each data point included the text content of the email body and the associated click-through rate.

## Preprocessing
1. **Text Cleaning**: The email text was preprocessed to remove any irrelevant characters, punctuation, and HTML tags.
2. **Tokenization**: The cleaned text was tokenized into individual words or tokens.
3. **Stopword Removal**: Common stopwords were removed to reduce noise in the data.
4. **Vectorization**: The tokenized text was converted into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.

## Model Architecture
The CTR prediction model comprised the following key components:

1. **NLP Embedding Layer**: An initial embedding layer learned representations of the email text. This layer could use pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.
2. **Gradient Boosting Algorithm**: Utilizing gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost to learn from the embedded text features and predict the click-through rate.

## Conclusion
The CTR prediction model developed using NLP techniques combined with gradient boosting algorithms showed promising results in predicting the click-through rates of email campaigns. Continuous monitoring and potential retraining with updated data would be essential for maintaining the model's performance over time.
